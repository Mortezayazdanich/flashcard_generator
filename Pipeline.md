# Flashcard Q/A Generation Pipeline

## Overview
This pipeline transforms raw text into high-quality flashcard Q/A pairs optimized for learning retention and educational effectiveness. The design balances accuracy, pedagogical value, and computational efficiency.

## Phase 1: Text Preprocessing

### 1.1 Text Cleaning & Normalization
**Purpose**: Prepare text for optimal processing
- Remove formatting artifacts (HTML tags, special characters)
- Normalize whitespace and line breaks
- Fix encoding issues and character corruption
- Standardize punctuation and quotation marks
- Remove headers, footers, page numbers, and metadata

**Rationale**: Clean text ensures accurate content extraction and prevents noise in Q/A generation.

### 1.2 Content Segmentation
**Purpose**: Break text into manageable, coherent units
- Paragraph-level segmentation for detailed concepts
- Section-level segmentation for broader topics
- Sentence-level segmentation for atomic facts
- Use NLP sentence boundary detection (spaCy, NLTK)

**Rationale**: Proper segmentation ensures Q/A pairs have appropriate scope and context.

### 1.3 Content Filtering
**Purpose**: Focus on educationally valuable content
- Remove boilerplate text (disclaimers, navigation)
- Filter out purely procedural content (unless specifically needed)
- Identify and prioritize key concepts using TF-IDF or keyword extraction
- Remove redundant or repetitive passages

**Rationale**: Focuses generation on high-value educational content.

## Phase 2: Content Analysis & Preparation

### 2.1 Semantic Chunking
**Purpose**: Create coherent knowledge units
- Use sliding window approach (150-300 words per chunk)
- Maintain sentence boundaries
- Overlap chunks by 20% to preserve context
- Tag chunks by topic using topic modeling (LDA/BERT)

**Rationale**: Optimal chunk size balances context preservation with processing efficiency.

### 2.2 Information Extraction
**Purpose**: Identify key learning elements
- Named Entity Recognition (people, places, dates, concepts)
- Fact extraction using dependency parsing
- Definition identification through linguistic patterns
- Cause-effect relationship mapping
- Process/procedure identification

**Rationale**: Structured extraction enables targeted question generation strategies.

### 2.3 Knowledge Graph Construction
**Purpose**: Map relationships between concepts
- Build entity-relationship graphs
- Identify hierarchical concept structures
- Map prerequisite dependencies
- Create semantic similarity clusters

**Rationale**: Understanding relationships enables better question sequencing and difficulty progression.

## Phase 3: Question Generation Strategies

### 3.1 Fact-Based Questions
**Types & Methods**:
- **Who/What/When/Where**: Direct entity extraction
- **Yes/No**: Binary classification based on statements
- **Fill-in-the-blank**: Mask key terms using NER results
- **Numerical**: Extract quantitative information

**Templates**:
- "Who was [PERSON] and what did they accomplish?"
- "What is the definition of [CONCEPT]?"
- "When did [EVENT] occur?"
- "Where is [LOCATION] situated?"

### 3.2 Conceptual Questions
**Types & Methods**:
- **Explain/Describe**: Target concept definitions and characteristics
- **Compare/Contrast**: Use semantic similarity to identify related concepts
- **Classify**: Group similar entities or concepts
- **Cause-Effect**: Extract causal relationships from text

**Templates**:
- "Explain the relationship between [CONCEPT A] and [CONCEPT B]"
- "What are the main characteristics of [CONCEPT]?"
- "How does [PROCESS] work?"

### 3.3 Application-Level Questions
**Types & Methods**:
- **Problem-solving**: Create scenarios requiring concept application
- **Analysis**: Ask for interpretation of information
- **Synthesis**: Combine multiple concepts
- **Evaluation**: Ask for judgment based on criteria

**Templates**:
- "Given [SCENARIO], how would you apply [CONCEPT]?"
- "What would happen if [CONDITION] changed?"
- "Evaluate the effectiveness of [APPROACH] in [CONTEXT]"

### 3.4 Multi-Format Generation
**Formats**:
- **Multiple Choice**: Generate distractors using semantic similarity
- **Short Answer**: Open-ended responses
- **True/False**: Convert statements with negation/modification
- **Matching**: Pair related concepts or definitions
- **Ordering**: Sequence events, processes, or priorities

## Phase 4: Answer Optimization

- Answer relevance > 0.8
- Minimum 3 words, maximum 100 words for answers
- Avoid questions with >5 correct answers

### 5.2 Duplicate Detection & Removal
**Methods**:
- Semantic similarity using sentence embeddings (BERT, Sentence-BERT)
- Exact match detection for questions and answers
- Fuzzy matching for near-duplicates
- Concept overlap analysis

**Thresholds**:
