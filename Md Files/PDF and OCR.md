📋 PDF & OCR Integration Plan for Flashcard Generator
🔍 Current Pipeline Analysis
Your existing pipeline is well-structured and can easily accommodate PDF/OCR input. The integration point is before Phase 1.1 (Text Cleaning), where we'll add a new Phase 0: Input Processing.

🏗️ Proposed Architecture
Phase 0: Input Processing (NEW)
Input → File Type Detection → PDF/Image Processing → Raw Text → Existing Pipeline
Integration Points:
Current: text = input("Enter text: ") in app.py
Enhanced: Support file uploads, auto-detect type, extract text, then feed to existing pipeline
📚 Library Recommendations

PDF Extraction:
    PyMuPDF (fitz) - RECOMMENDED
        ✅ Fastest and most accurate
        ✅ Handles complex layouts well
        ✅ Supports images and annotations
        ✅ Active development


    pdfplumber - FALLBACK
        ✅ Excellent for tables and complex layouts
        ✅ User-friendly API
        ⚠️ Slower than PyMuPDF

OCR Solutions:
    EasyOCR - RECOMMENDED
        ✅ No external dependencixes
        ✅ 80+ languages supported
        ✅ Good accuracy out of the box
        ✅ GPU acceleration support
    Tesseract (pytesseract) - ALTERNATIVE
        ✅ Industry standard
        ✅ Highly configurable
        ⚠️ Requires system installation
        ⚠️ More setup complexity
🛠️ Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Basic PDF Support (Week 1)
# New file: input_processor.py
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    # PyMuPDF implementation
    
def detect_file_type(file_path):
    # Auto-detect PDF vs image vs text
    
def process_input(input_source):
    # Unified interface for all input types

Phase 2: OCR Integration (Week 2)
def extract_text_from_image(image_path):
    # EasyOCR implementation
    
def enhance_ocr_text(raw_ocr_text):
    # Post-processing for OCR artifacts

Phase 3: Quality Enhancement (Week 3)
def clean_ocr_artifacts(text):
    # Fix common OCR errors
    # Remove line breaks in wrong places
    # Fix spacing issues
    
def validate_text_quality(text):
    # Quality scoring for OCR output

Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
    Batch processing multiple files
    PDF page range selection
    Image preprocessing (deskewing, noise reduction)
    Confidence scoring for OCR results
